I lost all my day trying to accomplish what handle.exe from microsoft does...

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle

handle [[-a [-l]] [-v|-vt] [-u] | [-c <handle> [-y]] | [-s]] [-p <process>|<pid>] [name]

Parameter	Description
-a	Dump information about all types of handles, not just those that refer to files. Other types include ports, Registry keys, synchronization primitives, threads, and processes.
-l	Just show pagefile-backed section handles.
-c	Closes the specified handle (interpreted as a hexadecimal number). You must specify the process by its PID.
WARNING: Closing handles can cause application or system instability.
-g	Print granted access.
-y	Don't prompt for close handle confirmation.
-s	Print count of each type of handle open.
-u	Show the owning user name when searching for handles.
-v	CSV output with comma delimiter.
-vt	CSV output with tab delimiter.
-p	Instead of examining all the handles in the system, this parameter narrows Handle's scan to those processes that begin with the name process. Thus:
handle -p exp
would dump the open files for all processes that start with "exp", which would include Explorer.
name	This parameter is present so that you can direct Handle to search for references to an object with a particular name.
For example, if you wanted to know which process (if any) has "c:\windows\system32" open you could type:
handle windows\system
The name match is case-insensitive and the fragment specified can be anywhere in the paths you are interested in.
